In recent years, material classification has become an active topic for reseachers with the main goal is providing the detail of material information for a vareties applications such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) \cite{r1}, robotic manipulation \cite{spong2006robot}, robotic navigation \cite{kim2013robot}, etc.

\paragraph*{â€¢}
Material of surfaces contribute valuable informations to understand the whole image. For example, Figure \ref{fig:f1} shows that with infomation about material which thoses bottles make of, computer could sort those bottles by weights, make a decision to choose which one is good to hold hot water or even know that it would be a risk to allow people bring a glass bottle which could be used as a weapon into a meeting between head of states.
